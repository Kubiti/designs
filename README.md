## Picasso Painting
This painting was done in HTML and CSS, and was part of the [CSS course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-intermediate-css-by-building-a-picasso-painting) of freecodecamp. By coding my own Picasso painting webpage, I learnt about SVG icons, CSS positioning, and reviewed some CSS skills I had learnt. Find link below :point_down:<br>
